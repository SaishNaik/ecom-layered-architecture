Problem:
Monolithic Code becomes complicated and complex since everything is packed into one thing
Adding new changes becomes difficult since the code is interconnected. New Changes can break existing working code
even if the change is minor.
Going through the code and maintaining it will become difficult since everything is highly coupled and to change/update one minor thing, we have to
understand whole thing
